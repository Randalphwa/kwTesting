The ideal way to enter a comment or query that will not be displayed when published, is to use the following exact syntax:

1) Start with a blank line
2) Enter: "[comment text]: #"

The "comment text" is your comment or query. Nothing must be added after the '#' character.

If that's a problem, simply start a line with "Comment:" or "Query:" followed by the text. As long as it gets removed
before publishing, it will not be a significant problem.

The following special characters are used in KeyWorks Software Markdown:

#   Indicates a heading -- level is determined by how many # characters are used

-   Indicates a bulleted list item

1.  Indicates a numbered list item (the numbers can repeat, i.e., they can all be 1. -- the list will be renumbered when displayed)

**text** displays the text as bold

_text_ displayes the text as italics

`text` dispalys the text in a monospace font

tab places the text after the tab in an indented block

[text](link) displayes the text as a hyperlink
